Multi(platform|runtime) typescript project monorepo
===================================================

Instructions to use:
1. `yarn set version berry`
2. `yarn config set nodeLinker node-modules` to use node-modules linker and save some headache for managing deps
2. `yarn build` to build all the projects and have their dist folder populated
3. You can now find the bundle of the platform specific library in the workspace/dist folder

To build for a specific platform
`yarn workspace <workspace-name> run build`

eg: `yarn workspace platform-node run build` will build for node js


Development
-----------

platform agnostic code shall be written in platform-core

platform specific code shall go in their own implementation workspace folder

for adding support for another platform, create a new module and make it a workspace
